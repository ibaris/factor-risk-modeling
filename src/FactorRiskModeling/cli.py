Module that contains the command line app. Why does this file exist, and why not put this in __main__?

You might be tempted to import things from __main__ later, but that will cause
problems: the code will get executed twice:

- When you run `python -mFactorRiskModeling` python will execute
  ``__main__.py`` as a script. That means there won't be any
  ``FactorRiskModeling.__main__`` in ``sys.modules``.
- When you import __main__ it will get executed again (as a module) because
  there's no ``FactorRiskModeling.__main__`` in ``sys.modules``.
